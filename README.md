Sentimental Analysis using Machine Learning

Project Overview

    The project uses the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive or negative. The dataset is preprocessed using 
    NLTK and scikit-learn libraries, and a logistic regression model is trained to classify the tweets. The model is then evaluated using accuracy score and saved 
    for future use.
